# Sustainable Feasibility Analysis: EVs vs. ICEVs in Vancouver  

A comparative analysis of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs) in Vancouver, evaluating environmental, economic, and social impacts toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

## üìå Overview  
This project assesses the sustainability feasibility of transitioning from ICEVs to EVs in Vancouver, BC. Using data-driven indicators (GHG emissions, energy consumption, cost savings), we project outcomes under 50% EV adoption by 2050 and benchmark performance against conventional vehicles.

**Key Questions Addressed**:  
- How do EVs reduce Vancouver‚Äôs carbon footprint compared to ICEVs?  
- What are the economic and social trade-offs of this transition?  
- How can policymakers accelerate EV adoption sustainably?

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology  
1. **Data Sources**:  
   - Metro Vancouver GHG reports, BC Hydro, CleanBC policies.  
   - Projections derived from lifecycle assessments (2022‚Äì2050).  

2. **Indicators**:  
   - **Environmental**: CO‚ÇÇ, NO‚ÇÇ, PM emissions, renewable energy usage.  
   - **Economic**: Charging infrastructure costs, job growth, fuel savings.  
   - **Social**: Affordability, user satisfaction, traffic safety.

## üìä Key Findings  

### **Environmental Impact**  
| Metric          | ICEVs (2050) | EVs (2050) | Improvement |  
|-----------------|-------------|------------|-------------|  
| CO‚ÇÇ Emissions   | 25,000 tons | 300 tons   | **98.8% reduction** |  
| Energy Use      | 450,000 MWh | 240,000 MWh | 46.7% lower |  
| Noise Pollution | High        | Near-zero  | ‚úÖ Quieter cities |  

### **Economic Benefits**  
- **Cost Savings**: EVs save **$2.8M/year** in avoided emissions by 2050.  
- **Job Creation**: 70,000 new jobs in EV infrastructure/manufacturing.  
- **Fuel Efficiency**: EVs use **0.15 kWh/km** vs. ICEVs‚Äô **7L/100km**.  

### **Social Equity**  
- Improved public health (lower NO‚ÇÇ/PM emissions).  
- Affordability parity with ICEVs expected by **2030**.
